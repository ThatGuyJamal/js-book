# Introduction

Yay you made it to the website! Currently im in the process of making a JavaScript mini series. 
After recording it, I realized I wanted my own book I could read as well, So I made this website.

Currently the website is only a landing page, but I plan to add content to it in the future, after the [mini series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfjHxdSdfKthUd5SEJr2e86qRpRSzVOEK) is finished.

This book will cover the basics of JavaScript, and will be a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn it.

You can join my [Discord Server]() to get updates on the progress of the series or programming in general.
