# `Hello World`

Computer Programming is a task many nerds such as myself are interested in, however, have trouble getting started with.
In this book, my goal is to get you up and running with the basics of Javascript, and hopefully get you more comfortable with the language.

### Before You Start

This book will assume that you are already familiar with the basics of [Compute Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) because its a massive topic in itself and builds
on the concepts we have learn here. Read this [guide](https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-computer-science-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-696379aa4e96) for more resources on Compute Science.

### I prefer to watch videos on YouTube

If your interested in learning more about the language, you can watch videos on YouTube. I personally have made a crash course broken into 3 parts, going
over the basics of the language. You can find that playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfjHxdSdfKthUd5SEJr2e86qRpRSzVOEK).
